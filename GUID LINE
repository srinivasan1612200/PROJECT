We are Predicting solar energy output using regression with temperature as a variable involves using historical data to model the relationship between temperature (x) and Humidity(y).
Here's a step-by-step guide to approach this problem:

1.DATA COLLECTION:
   - Gather historical data on solar energy output and corresponding temperature readings. This data can often be found through local weather stations or solar panel monitoring systems.

2.DATA PREPROCESSING:
   - Clean the data by handling missing values, outliers, and ensuring consistent units.
   - Split the data into training and test sets to evaluate the performance of your model.

3.EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS (EDA):
   - Visualize the relationship between temperature and solar energy output using scatter plots.
   - Compute summary statistics to understand the distribution and central tendencies of your data.

4.FEATURE SELECTION:
   - Temperature will be your primary feature (independent variable, x).
   - You might also consider adding other relevant features (e.g., time of day, humidity, cloud cover) if available.

5.MODEL SELECTION:
   - Choose a regression model. For a simple relationship, a linear regression model may suffice. For more complex relationships, consider polynomial regression, decision trees, or other advanced models.

6.MODEL TRAINING:
   - Fit your chosen model to the training data.
   - Use libraries such as scikit-learn in Python to facilitate this process.

7.MODEL EVALUATION:
   - Evaluate the model's performance using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), or R-squared.
   - Compare the performance on the training and test sets to check for overfitting or underfitting.

8.MODEL TUNING:
 - Adjust hyperparameters and possibly include additional features to improve model performance.

9.PREDICTION:
   - Use the trained model to predict solar energy output based on new temperature data.
